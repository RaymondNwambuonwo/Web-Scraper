# Web-Scraper

## Overview

Automated threat intelligence collection system that gathers CVE data and security news from multiple public sources, providing risk assessment and comprehensive threat analysis for cybersecurity operations and OSINT gathering.

## Purpose

- Automate collection of current threat intelligence from multiple sources
- Analyze and categorize security vulnerabilities and emerging threats
- Generate actionable threat intelligence reports for security teams
- Practice respectful web scraping and data analysis techniques

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.6+ with requests and BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping
- feedparser for RSS feed processing and XML parsing
- pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- JSON/CSV for structured data storage and export
- Logging framework for operational monitoring

## Features

- ✅ CVE data collection from MITRE database with severity assessment
- ✅ Security news aggregation from multiple trusted sources
- ✅ Respectful scraping with robots.txt compliance and rate limiting
- ✅ Threat classification and risk level assessment algorithms
- ✅ Comprehensive threat intelligence report generation
- ✅ Multiple output formats (JSON, CSV) for integration
- ✅ Robust error handling with retry logic and timeout management

## How to Run

```bash
# 3. Run individual scrapers
python cve_scraper.py          # CVE data only
python security_news_scraper.py # Security news only

# 4. Run comprehensive collection
python threat_intel_scraper.py  # Full threat intelligence suite

# 5. View results
ls data/
cat data/comprehensive_threat_report.json
```

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Integration with MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)
- [ ] IoC (Indicators of Compromise) extraction from security articles
- [ ] Machine learning for automated threat classification and scoring
- [ ] Real-time streaming data processing for continuous monitoring
- [ ] Dark web monitoring capabilities for advanced threat intelligence
- [ ] Integration with SIEM platforms for automated alert generation

## What I Learned

- Web scraping best practices including respectful data collection and robots.txt compliance
